# Backup Directory - PRODUCTION

This directory contains timestamped backups of **PRODUCTION** Terraform state files.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPORTANCE ⚠️

**These backups are essential for production disaster recovery!**

## Backup Format

- **State backups**: `terraform.tfstate.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- **Output backups**: `outputs.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`

## Retention Policy

- **NEVER delete production backups** without approval
- Keep minimum 90 days of backups
- Archive to long-term storage after 30 days
- Replicate to secondary Azure region

## Manual Backup

```bash
# ALWAYS create backup before production changes
../../../scripts/state-manager.sh backup production
```

## Recovery Procedures

In case of state corruption:

1. **STOP all Terraform operations**
2. **Assess the situation**
3. **Contact infrastructure team**
4. **Restore from most recent backup**
5. **Validate restoration**
6. **Document incident**

**Note**: Production backups are automatically created by deployment scripts.
